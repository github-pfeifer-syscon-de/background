Is it really worth to do something that is already available
with e.g. stellarium?

It depends what you expect.
if you want the full package with much more details and
i guess the best precision that is available,
go for a astronomy application.

On the other hand, if you want some infos on a regular basis,
this offers you some option with a app that does
not take a whole bunch of resources
(but i must admit there are more needed than i expected).
And as a side effect, some insight might be easier to gain
at a somewhat smaller scale...

Depends on genericImg see there for build instructions.
